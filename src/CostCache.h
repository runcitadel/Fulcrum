/// A cost-based cache, allowing for memory-bounded caching.
///
/// This class is more or less exactly like a QCache, except it is thread-safe. It wraps QCache operations with
/// a std::shared_mutex.  const methods acquire the mutex with a shared lock, whereas non-const methods acquire the
/// mutex exclusively (with the exception of operator[] & object() which take an exclusive lock because they update
/// the LRU linked list).
///
/// Note that we modified the API to QCache.
///
/// 1. We made all the costs be unsigned ints, which is more compatible with C++'s std::size_t and thus produces
///    fewer warnings for the way we will use this cache.
///
/// 2. This class does throw for the following 2 methods: the constructor & setMaxCost, which both require maxCost
///    to be nonzero and smaller than INT_MAX.
///
/// 3. We return the contained object by value rather than as a pointer.  This is because returning a pointer to the
///    object would not be thread safe.  Instead, we copy-construct the returned value with the lock held.  RVO and/or
///    copy elision should make this sufficiently efficient. If client code wants to avoid any copying, it is free to
///    use Qt's implicitly shared containers such as QVector, etc as the value type.
///
/// 4. Inserted objects must be copy-constructible.
///
/// Note: Purging uses an LRU-based strategy, whereby the least recently used and/or inserted items are purged in a
/// loop until totalCost() < maxCost().  Accessing an item via operator[] or object() will refresh its status as most
/// recently used implicitly (which is why an exclusive lock is used for those two methods).
